    Geodes is a software application designed to facilitate the creation of geometric descriptive sketches.
    The program offers a variety of tools as well for adding points, lines, and plans by their projections and others,
    Allowing users to quickly achieve their projections clearly and efficiently. While still in development, Geodes has shown promising results and has the potential to become a valuable tool for architects,
    engineers, and anyone else who works with 3D to 2D projections designs.

    We Developed a board game with Java 8 and JavaFX, applying MVC design pattern principles. 
    The gameplay has similarities to Go, where players take turns placing point to occupy 
    territories on the board and to form enclosed spaces with point of other player.
    Used Java and applied MVC architectural pattern, encompassing areas like collections, multithreading, networking, algorithms and memory optimization. 
    The project provided hands-on reinforcement of Java concepts learned from "Introduction to Java Programming" by Y. Daniel Liang.
